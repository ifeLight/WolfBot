/**
 * A strategy that re-open a previously closed position (closed by WolfBot or manually) after
 * price moves again a certain percentage in the direction of your previous position (from the close price).
 * This is helpful if you have a strong bias in one direction but also want to trade cautious at a
 * support/resistance line and always place a stop.
 * This strategy should run on a low candle size (1min) to react quickly.
 * You can use this strategy with manual stops too. It will re-open positions that have not been closed by WolfBot.
