// TODO ExchangeSpike Strategy (not really "Arbitrage")
// if the value on an exchange suddenly drops (compared to others) this might mean a local bull-trap + panic/margin sell on that exchange
// if the same drop doesn't occur on other exchanges -> buy immediately
// on those spikes the exchange often lags -> detect that in get/post methods
// if DASH "instant send" would work between exchanges we could even use that as a real Arbitrage Strategy
