/**
 * spread = volatility, BBannds
 * Rally:
 1. Increased spread and volume              ->  Demand is present
 2. Increased spread and decreased volume    ->  A lack of supply
 3. Decreased spread and volume              ->  A lack of demand
 4. Decreased spread and increased volume    ->  Supply is coming into the market

 Reaction:
 1. Increased spread and volume              ->  Supply is present
 2. Increased spread and decreased volume    ->  A lack of demand, desire to sell
 3. Decreased spread and volume              ->  A lack of supply
 4. Decreased spread and increased volume    ->  Demand is coming into the market
